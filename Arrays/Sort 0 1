Problem statement
You have been given an integer array/list(ARR) of size N that contains only integers, 0 and 1. Write a function to sort this array/list. Think of a solution which scans the array/list only once and don't require use of an extra array/list.

Note:
You need to change in the given array/list itself. Hence, no need to return or print anything. 

Sample Input 1:
1
7
0 1 1 0 1 0 1
Sample Output 1:
0 0 0 1 1 1 1
Sample Input 2:
2
8
1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1
5
0 1 0 1 0
Sample Output 2:
0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 1 1 

//solutiom

void sortZeroesAndOne(int input[], int size)
{
   

    int left = 0, right = size - 1;

    while (left < right) {
        while (input[left] == 0 && left < right) {
            left++;
        }
        while (input[right] == 1 && left < right) {
            right--;
        }
        if (left < right) {
            std::swap(input[left], input[right]);
            left++;
            right--;
        }
    }
}
