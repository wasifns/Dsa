Problem statement
You have been given an integer array/list(ARR) of size 'N'. It only contains 0s, 1s and 2s. Write a solution to sort this array/list.

Note :
Try to solve the problem in 'Single Scan'. ' Single Scan' refers to iterating over the array/list just once or to put it in other words, you will be visiting each element in the array/list just once.

Sample Input 1 :
2
6
0 1 2 2 1 0
7
0 1 2 1 2 1 2
Sample Output 1 :
0 0 1 1 2 2
0 1 1 1 2 2 2
Sample Input 2 :
2
7
2 2 2 1 1 1 0
6
2 1 2 0 1 0
Sample Output 2 :
0 1 1 1 2 2 2
0 0 1 1 2 2

    int low = 0, mid = 0, high = n - 1;

    while (mid <= high) {
        switch (arr[mid]) {
            case 0:
                std::swap(arr[low++], arr[mid++]);
                break;
            case 1:
                mid++;
                break;
            case 2:
                std::swap(arr[mid], arr[high--]);
                break;
        }
    }
}
