arrays
Problem statement
Given an array/list 'ARR' of integers and a position ‘M’. You have to reverse the array after that position.

Example:

We have an array ARR = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} and M = 3 , considering 0 
based indexing so the subarray {5, 6} will be reversed and our 
output array will be {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 5}.
  
Sample Input 1:
2
6 3
1 2 3 4 5 6
5 2
10 9 8 7 6
Sample Output 1:
1 2 3 4 6 5
10 9 8 6 7
Explanation 1:
For the first test case, 
Considering 0-based indexing we have M = 3 so the 
subarray[M+1 … N-1] has to be reversed.
Therefore the required output will be {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 5}.

For the second test case, 
Considering 0-based indexing we have M = 2 so the 
subarray[M+1 … N-1] has to be reversed.
Therefore the required output will be {10, 9, 8, 6, 7}.
